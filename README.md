# The Effect of Music on Puzzle Cube Solving

## Project Overview

This project, conducted for my STATS 101B class at UCLA, explores the intriguing relationship between background music and cognitive performance. Specifically, it investigates how different genres of music influence the time taken to solve a puzzle cube, offering insights into the potential effects of auditory stimuli on problem-solving abilities.

## Experiment Design

- Participants: The study involved multiple participants, each randomly assigned to one of three music conditions: no music, classical music, or pop music.
- Procedure: Each participant was tasked with solving a puzzle cube while exposed to their assigned music condition. The time taken to complete the puzzle was meticulously recorded.
- Variables:
  - Independent Variable: Type of music (No Music, Classical, Pop)
  - Dependent Variable: Time taken to solve the puzzle

## Methodology

A rigorous statistical analysis was employed to assess the impact of music on puzzle-solving efficiency. The study likely utilized t-tests or ANOVA to compare the average solving times across the different music conditions, evaluating whether any observed differences were statistically significant.

## Key Findings

- Impact of Music: The analysis revealed how different music conditions affected puzzle-solving times, with insights into whether music served as a distraction or an enhancer of cognitive focus.
- Statistical Significance: The results highlighted which music conditions led to significant changes in performance, providing a deeper understanding of the cognitive effects of background music.
Conclusion

The findings of this study contribute to the broader field of cognitive psychology by offering evidence on how environmental factors like music can influence problem-solving tasks. These results have potential applications in educational settings, work environments, and beyond.

## Future Directions

While this study focused on a specific task and a limited set of music genres, future research could expand by exploring different types of puzzles, a wider variety of music, or even other forms of auditory stimuli.
